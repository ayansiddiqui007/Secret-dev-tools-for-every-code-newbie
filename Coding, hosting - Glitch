This really blew my mind. It sounded like just another Github alternative on paper, but when I arrived on the site, all the vibrant colors, 
cool whimsical illustrations……! It’s like Github but with unicorns and rainbows; like Willy Wonka’s chocolate factory but for coders! 
It’s got so much personality and confidence in their branding, that I’m super impressed. Such a fun and delightful experience just browsing through all the code repos. 
And it’s not just a prettier Github, but a better one too. Glitch allows you to code collaboratively in realtime, much like Google Docs. 
This makes Github feel like Windows 95 Microsoft Word (oh wait, Github was acquired by Microsoft lol). 
You also see your site or app deployed live in a preview window with a unique subdomain (or custom domain), much like Codepen and JSFiddle. 
There’s definitely something of a trend here, where community-generated content is built around a collaborative tool.
